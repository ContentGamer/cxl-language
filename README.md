# Welcome to the ContentXLang

This language is different than any ESOLang out there, it has the syntax of c++ and c#.
This is of course, an interpreted programming language.


> [!CAUTION]
> Use this at your own risk lol.

You can't use comments in this ESOLang language.

## Basic Printing
```typescript
THIS IS esolangCXL__HEADER&&;
USE GLOBAL THING AND _NAMESPACE_ std//;

vid_ CXL_MAIN(list_shut[]? args): {
    cxl_printf(&Hello world!&);
};
```
Don't forget to include a MAIN entry point!

## Variables (Strings)
```typescript
THIS IS esolangCXL__HEADER&&;
USE GLOBAL THING AND _NAMESPACE_ std//;

c test = &Hey World!&;
```

## Variables (Numbers)
```typescript
THIS IS esolangCXL__HEADER&&;
USE GLOBAL THING AND _NAMESPACE_ std//;
USE GLOBAL THING AND _NAMESPACE_ std_numbers//;

c operation = N2M + N3M;
c operationA = N2M plus N3M;

l operatL = N5M + N454326M - N3333M;
l operatLA = N5M plus N454326M minus N3333M;
```

## Run Javascript Code
Since this ESOLang is compiled by typescript, you can use javascript code, which means that NodeJS Packages could be possible.

```typescript
THIS IS esolangCXL__HEADER&&;
USE GLOBAL THING AND _NAMESPACE_ std//;

vid_ CXL_MAIN(list_shut[]? args): {
    console.log("wassup");
};
```

## UPCOMING FEATURES

- [ ] Intellisense
- [ ] VSCode Extension
- [ ] More Variable types
- [ ] Custom Packages Made by users
